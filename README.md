This is a Matlab class that allows selecting the optimal physical impact model among a set of candidate models.
The selection is based on the TOPSIS multi-criteria decision making algorithm. 
The criteria are "Geographical area", "Statistical refinement", "Model quality", and "User requirements".
The weights for TOPSIS are set up using the Analytic Hierarchy Process.
